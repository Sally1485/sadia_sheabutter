Rich in vitamins A, E, and F, it is known for its deeply moisturizing and healing properties. For the skin, shea butter helps to soothe dryness, reduce inflammation, fade scars, and improve elasticity, making it ideal for all skin types. When applied to hair, it strengthens strands, reduces breakage, and nourishes the scalp, promoting healthy growth and shine.
